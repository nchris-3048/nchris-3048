- 👋 Hi, I’m @nchris-3048
- 👀 I’m interested in open transparent sharing, and constructive cooperative ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently plan on learning how to implement a WD task. I also am examening alternative methods of implementing Micrium RTOS tasks. The current project uses the structure and code found in project examples, Silab tutorials and the Micrium User Manual. Goal is to examen one of the example methods buried in the kernal 201 to see if it makes sense to apply any of it to the existing project. The reason to do this would be to ease others coming from that background into getting up to speed in this project. The would be done to the extent that the current project's reliablity and time to market is not negatively impacted. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on next generation acoustic receiver and more.
